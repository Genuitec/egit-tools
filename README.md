Now chances of getting regressions or incomplete features into your stable branch are minimal.|Don’t let your customers wait for features and bug fixes. With Gerrit Workflow only reviewed and verified changes make it to the stable branch. No more holding up a release while you wait for incomplete or buggy features.|

##Create Change Branches
Use change branches to avoid dependencies between commits. Create a change branch every time you start working on a bug fix or a small feature. Set up a target stable branch and use *Push to Upstream*.
##Create Feature Branches
Use feature branches to keep work on new features out of the stable branch until the code matures enough. Create a new feature branch for each new feature and enjoy using *Push to Upstream*.
##Commit Changes for Review
If you use Gerrit Tooling for switching between branches, the repository is always correctly configured to push upstream. Bye, bye *Push to Gerrit*, welcome *Commit and Push*.
##Fetch Code Changes
We’ve simplified the process of downloading code changes. Just select a change you want from the list of open changes and choose the patchset version.
##Create and Push Tags
This is a great way to tag multiple repositories at once.
