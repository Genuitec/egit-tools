##Create and Switch to Change Branches
Use change branches to avoid dependencies between commits. Create a change branch every time you start working on a bug fix or a small feature. Set up a target stable branch and use *Push to Upstream*.

##Create and Switch to Feature Branches
Use feature branches to keep work on new features out of the stable branch until the code matures enough. Create a new feature branch for each new feature and enjoy using *Push to Upstream*.

##Commit Changes for Review
If you use Gerrit Tooling for switching between branches, the repository is always correctly configured to push upstream. Bye, bye *Push to Gerrit*, welcome *Commit and Push*.

##Fetch Code Changes
We’ve simplified the process of downloading code changes. Just select a change you want from the list of open changes and choose the patchset version.

##Create and Push Tags
This is a great way to tag multiple repositories at once.
